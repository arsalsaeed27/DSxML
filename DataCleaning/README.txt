in this ipynib file, I worked on a dataset called "movies.csv"
I imported pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries.
since my task was to do data cleaning and EDA, firstly I checked the duplicates and removed them. this cleaned the data to some extent. 
then I removed every little typo or a mistake done during data entry. and then I removed the rows and columns which were unnecessary. this made it more clean and good looking.
there was a 'STARS' column which had both directors and stars in it, so I extracted 2 columns from it. one being named as 'Director ' and other as 'Stars'. and I deleted the original column afterwards.
finally I performed EDA on the cleaned dataset by using the python libraries. graphs like hist,bar,and scatter plot helped me analyse the data briefly.
I enjoyed a lot doing this task.
