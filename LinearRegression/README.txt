in this repository, I explored Linear Regression by first using builtin functions like fit() and predict() from Scikitlearn lib to understand how regression models are trained and used for predictions 

after that, i  implemented Linear Regression from scratch using only basic Python code, calculating the slope, intercept, and predictions manually. i did this for both simple and multiple linear regression, where I computed coefficients for multiple features without relying on any machine learning libraries, I also learnt regression metrics like MAE,MSV,RMSV, and R2score.
then i made a project of house price prediction, its in the next folder
